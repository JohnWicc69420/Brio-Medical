<h3><span><a href="https://brio-medical.com/vitamin-c-iv/"><span style="font-size: 26px;">pH Neutral High Dosage Vitamin C Therapy</span></a><strong><br>
</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>At Brio&#45;Medical, we recognize the evolving landscape of cancer treatment and continuously seek innovative methods to enhance patient care. One such advanced therapy is the pH Neutral High Dosage Vitamin C treatment, administered in dosages of up to 200 grams. This therapy represents a significant leap forward in integrative cancer care.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Science Behind the Therapy&#58;</strong> Vitamin C, known for its antioxidant properties, becomes a pro-oxidant at high dosages, specifically targeting cancer cells. The high-dosage Vitamin C therapy, when administered intravenously, achieves serum concentrations that are not obtainable through oral ingestion.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>pH Neutral Formulation&#58;</strong> The pH-neutral formulation of this Vitamin C therapy minimizes the risk of gastrointestinal distress and other potential side effects, making it safer and more tolerable for patients undergoing treatment.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Targeting Cancer Cells&#58;</strong> High levels of Vitamin C generate hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular space. Unlike normal cells, many cancer cells lack the ability to break down hydrogen peroxide, which leads to their damage or death, sparing healthy cells in the process.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Selective Toxicity to Cancer Cells&#58;</strong> The therapy targets cancer cells without harming normal cells, a significant advantage over conventional treatments.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Boosting the Immune System&#58;</strong> Vitamin C is crucial for immune system function, potentially aiding the body&apos;s natural defenses against cancer.</span></p>
<p><span>At Brio&#45;Medical, pH Neutral High Dosage Vitamin C therapy is part of our comprehensive approach to cancer treatment. It embodies our commitment to offering therapies that are both innovative and patient&#45;centric, focusing on improving outcomes and quality of life for our patients.</span></p>
