<h1>Integrative Oncology Therapies Offered at Brio-Medical:</h1>

<h3>Localized Hyperthermia (Mag-Ray)</h3>
<p>The far-infrared heated lamp is coated with a mineral formulation of 33 different elements. This treatment uses far-infrared electromagnetic energy to target cells and the surrounding tissue area. We use this to heat localized areas as opposed to whole-body hyperthermia. Human cells are thought to have a high level of absorption, causing the infrared electromagnetic energy to penetrate deep within.</p>
<p>The possible benefits include decreased joint pain, decreased stiffness, decreased muscle pain, and circulatory support. Adding castor oil with a wool flannel provides detoxification support and promotes the healing of damaged cells/tissues.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment use:</strong> Patients are recommended to complete this 45-minute treatment every other day.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/weber-laser/">Weber Laser</a></h3>
<p>The Weber Laser was developed in Germany and is based on the usage of soft lasers. Unlike surgical lasers that destroy tissue and cells, soft lasers supply our body with energy to trigger numerous regenerative processes. The therapy stimulates and regenerates cells and tissues and accelerates healing processes. Unlike surgical lasers, Low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT) is non-destructive, painless, and works on bio-stimulation. In many cases, it is a fantastic alternative to surgery and/or drugs and allows physicians to treat the root causes of diseases instead of only symptoms.</p>
<p>Medical laser therapy applies blue, green, yellow, red, and infrared lasers. Each color develops different effects which are evoked by the stimulation of specific cellular components, such as growth factors or cells of our immune system.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment use:</strong> Patients are recommended to complete this 45-minute treatment every other day.</p>

<h3>Multi Lumen (Laser Therapy)</h3>
<p>Used to stimulate circulation, reduce recovery times, and combat stubborn <a href="https://brio-medical.com/conditions/" title="conditions">conditions</a> like neuropathy and acute chronic pain. Also used to treat deep tissues, muscles, joints, and organs, thereby significantly reducing treatment time.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/evox-therapy/">Mind-Body Emotional Wellness Counseling</a></h3>
<p>Zyto EVOX Perception Reframing/Emotional Release is a Game Changer! Anita, the Mind-Body Specialist uses several techniques to help individuals shift away from negative thoughts that often run in the background of our minds. EVOX Therapy helps to get to the “Root Cause of the Illness.” Perception Reframing aids a person in identifying, targeting, and resolving “stuck” areas in life. The “energetic field” is where the seeds of health and disease reside before they develop physically.</p>
<p>You are gently guided through forgiveness and letting go of Stress, Anxiety, Fear, Childhood Trauma, Anger, Depression, Guilt, Grief, Abuse, and Worry, which are the precursors of disease and cancer. Replacing those stressors with Love, Joy, Peace, Hope, Clarity, Strength, and Healing. EVOX remote sessions are available during your After Care Home Healing Journey.</p>

<h3>Natural Immunotherapy</h3>
<p>Immunotherapy uses substances or peptides that naturally occur in the body to alter the functions of the immune system by enhancing mental function, regulating neurotransmitters, and decreasing stress, anxiety, and anti-viral properties. It also improves sleep, reduces chronic pain, and protects against oxidative damage in the body.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/iv-therapy-cancer/">IV Therapies</a></h3>
<p>Brio-Medical specializes in various types of holistic IV Therapy for increased energy, detoxification, and overall well-being. Intravenous nutrient therapy may produce immediate benefits such as increased energy, mental clarity, and feelings of well-being, but it may also cause a detox reaction that leaves you feeling tired or ill.</p>
<p>As nutrients flood your cells, toxins are pulled out of tissues and flood your system. This detoxification process is temporary and is accelerated with other detoxification therapies.</p>
<p><a href="https://brio-medical.com/contact/">Brio-Medical, Scottsdale AZ</a> was interviewed by Dr. Joseph <a href="https://brio-medical.com/vitamin-c-iv/mercola-benefits-of-high-dose-vitamin-c-for-cancer/">Mercola</a> about the benefits of Vitamin C IV in cancer treatment.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/cancer-nutritional-counseling/">Nutrition</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/ozone-therapy/">Ozone (Rectal and Bladder Insufflation)</a></h3>
<p>As the name suggests, Rectal Insufflation refers to introducing ozone into the body through the rectum. Oxygen (O2) has been infused rectally during surgery for years, due to the fact that oxygen is easily absorbed through the walls of the colon. The same is true for ozone. This method can be used for multiple disease processes from colon-related conditions to chronic autoimmune conditions.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/hocatt-ozone-sauna/">Ozone Sauna</a></h3>
<p>Oxygen is made up of two oxygen atoms, and ozone is

 made up of three. It is known that ozone is the most effective therapy in its ability to oxygenate the body as it increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. This increase in oxygen assists in clearing out toxins, improving circulation, and eliminating viruses. Ozone therapy uses a special ozone sauna that helps to distribute the ozone evenly throughout the body and facilitates detoxification.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/exercise-with-oxygen-training/">Exercise With Oxygen Training (EWOT)</a></h3>
<p>Exercise With Oxygen Training (EWOT) therapy combines the benefits of increased oxygen levels with exercise to enhance athletic performance, improve recovery, and support overall health. EWOT works by increasing the amount of oxygen delivered to your cells, which helps to improve your body’s ability to perform and recover from exercise. This combination can help to enhance endurance, strength, and overall health.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/sonix-vibrational-therapy/">Sonix Vibrational Therapy</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://brio-medical.com/ultraviolet-blood-irradiation/">Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation (UVB Therapy Ozonated Blood IV)</a></h3>
<p>Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation (UVB Therapy) involves exposing a small amount of blood to ultraviolet light before reintroducing it into the body.
